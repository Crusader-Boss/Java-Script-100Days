# const, let and var

## var vs let

--> Var is globally scoped while let & const are block scoped.
--> Var can be updated and redeclared within its scope.
--> Let can be updated but not redeclared.
--> var variables are initialized with undefined whereas let and const variables are not initialized.

## Const

const is alltogether diffrent from var and let 
--> const must be initialized during declaration unlike let and var.
--> const can neither be updated nor redeclared.

const is the constant.

## pro tip

Do Not use var unless editing old code. old as in early 2000's code.
Try to use const more if u cant use const use let and avoid var at all costs. 
This will help reduce error in your code.
